Maintainer: Alexander W Blocker <ablocker@gmail.com>
Description: This package implements the methods developed and evaluated in
    Blocker and Airoldi (2011) and Airoldi and Blocker (2012). These include the
    authors' own dynamic multilevel model with calibration based upon a Gaussian
    state-space model in addition to implementations of the methods of Tebaldi &
    West (1998; Poisson-Gamma model with MCMC sampling), Zhang et al. (2002;
    tomogravity), Cao et al. (2000; Gaussian model with mean-variance relation),
    and Vardi (1996; method of moments). Data from the 1router network of Cao et
    al. (2000), the Abilene network of Fang et al. (2007), and the CMU network
    of Blocker and Airoldi (2011) are included for testing and reproducibility.
