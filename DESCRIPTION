Description: networkTomography implements the methods developed and evaluated in
    Blocker & Airoldi (2011). These include that authors' own dynamic multilevel
    model with calibration based upon a Gaussian state-space model in addition
    to implementations of the methods of Tebaldi & West (1998; Poisson-Gamma
    model with MCMC sampling), Cao et al. (2000; Gaussian model with
    mean-variance relation), and Vardi (1996; method of moments). Data from the
    1router network of Cao et al. (2000) is included for testing and
    reproducibility.
